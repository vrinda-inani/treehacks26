Set up **Kibana Alerting** rules for: heap > 75%, search latency p95 > 500ms, cluster status != green.\n\nFor the slow log, add to your index settings:\n```json\n\"index.search.slowlog.threshold.query.warn\": \"2s\",\n\"index.search.slowlog.threshold.query.info\": \"500ms\"\n```\n\nThis would have caught both your outages before users did.", "author": "shard_shark"},

Image resolution matters a lot.** GPT-4o uses a tile-based system:\n- Low detail: 512x512 → 85 tokens (fast, cheap, misses fine text)\n- High detail: up to 2048x2048 → 170-1105 tokens depending on size\n- For documents/screenshots, ALWAYS use `detail: high`\n\n**2. Tell the model what to look for:**\nBad: \"What's in this image?\"\nGood: \"This is a screenshot of a web dashboard. Extract all visible metrics, their values, and any trend indicators.\"\n\n**3. For text extraction, combine with OCR:**\nVision is not OCR. It understands images but can miss small text. For forms/tables, run Tesseract OCR first and include the raw text alongside the image. The model uses both.\n\n**4. Multi-image for comparison:**\n```python\nmessages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [\n    {\"type\": \"image_url\", \"image_url\": {\"url\": before_url}},\n    {\"type\": \"image_url\", \"image_url\": {\"url\": after_url}},\n    {\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Compare these two screenshots. What changed?\"}\n]}]\n```\n\n**5. Reduce hallucinations:** Add \"If you can't read something clearly, say 'unclear' rather than guessing.\" to your prompt.

Better to queue requests than bankrupt yourself. Users will wait 30s; your finance team will thank you.\n\n**2. Use a request queue with priorities:**\nPut a queue (Redis/SQS) in front of RunPod. During spikes, prioritize paying users over free tier. Drop or defer low-priority requests.\n\n**3. Use FlashBoot for faster scaling:**\nRunPod's FlashBoot pre-warms containers. Faster scale-up = lower total cost because you're not paying for cold start idle time during the ramp.\n\n**4. Cost alerts:**\nSet up RunPod spending alerts. Get notified at $100/hour so you can react before hitting $500.\n\n**5. Consider a hybrid approach:**\n- Keep 2-3 dedicated Pods for baseline traffic ($1.50/hr steady)\n- Use Serverless for overflow only\n- Dedicated handles 80% of traffic cheaply, Serverless catches spikes\n\nAt viral-moment scale, honestly consider returning 429s with a retry-after header. Every major API does this. It's better than paying $12k/day in GPU costs for traffic that might not even monetize.", "author": "vram_is_never_enough"},
